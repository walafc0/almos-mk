# The ALMOS-MK operating system

ALMOS (Advanced Locality Management Operating System) is an open-source
research operating system currently under development at the SoC department of
the LIP6 Laboratory (UPMC Sorbonne Universit√©s). This new research operating
system has been started from scratch and it is targeting cc-NUMA
multi/many-cores. It is intended to investigate the scalability of the
different components of an operating system on a current and future many-cores.

ALMOS is currently used in several research projects and Master degree courses
at LIP6 and UPMC. Its development is currently a work-package in the SHARP
(Scalable Heterogeneous ARchitecture for Processing) MEDEA+ European project
which is an HPC oriented project leaded by Bull. ALMOS is also deeply used in
TSUNAMY - an ANR national research project aiming to co-design a new security
solution for information processing on multi/many-core processors. ALMOS has
been originally developed as a part of the TSAR MEDEA+ European project.

ALMOS allows several shared-memory parallel applications to scale up to +1024
cores on the TSAR (Tera-Scale ARchitecture) single-chip cc-NUMA many-core.
