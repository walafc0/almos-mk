Shared structures are:
At the process level:
	-> File system (only matadata and data caches)
	-> Task manager table
	-> Task vm_region if we support inter process com (not the case in almos)

	specific to ALMOS:
	-> DQDT to allocate the approprite proc/mem ( can be avoided for now by directly using the
	the task next_cluster field, and always redirecting the allocations to the local cluster)
	-> 


Efficient com with other proc:
	- devellope physical access techniques at the software level
		- fine grained at the C language level
		- at the assemebler level, by inserting macro to switch space
	- get some help from the hardware (put an paddr_extension for the stack (most important) and
	  one for the instructions (secondary) )
