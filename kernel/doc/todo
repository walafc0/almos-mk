TODO:
(- Mesuring RPC: * Fix the ISR of IPCs) almost done

- There is to function for the same purpose : ppm_ppn2vma and pmm_ppn2vma (ppm != pmm) !!!
	Only the second that support any ppn, the first support only local ppn!

- Fix print exception output

- lock boot_dmsg

- RPC: check the sending of chars 

- cpu-remote.h: avoid disabling irqs...

- optimimize memcpy and remote_memcpy in case of not aligned copy ?




- Make the com. algorithm independent of the hardware (no coherence, no shared mem... see multi kernel)

- FIX: void pmm_cache_flush_raddr func
- chech/give a type for addresse in a cluster, don't transport adresses using uint_t

-REmote tread create: see fixmes in sys_thread_creat, task.c

-FIXME: rename as cpu_strlen_uspace

-FIXME: if we send an empty path (not a NULL but an empty path) to the chdir syscall what will happen (what errror ro return) 













TOEXPLORE:
- alarm manager could be ameliorated with relative time techinique rather than moving all the alarms at a new alamr ?
